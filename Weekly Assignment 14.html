<h1>Weekly Assignment 14</h1>
<p>At the beginning of class, I decided to do a deep dive into the Seinfeld's Scripts. This analysis gave me an understanding of how large of a role each of the main characters in the Seinfeld show played in season 1 (premier season), season 9 (final season), and across all seasons (seasons 1-9).  Now, as we wrap up the class, I have learned how to communicate information like what I collected on Seinfeld's scripts in new ways. Each method of communication data information can be beneficial depending on the audience and reason for presenting the information. It is just as important to gauge your audience and purpose when collecting and analyzing your data. 
<br>
<br>
For example, if I were going to present the information I collected to a group of people who have never watched Seinfeld, the best way to communicate this information would be through RevealJS. RevealJS would give me the ability to display the information that I collected and allow me to create slides that would give my audience of non-Seinfeld watchers enough of a foundation to understand the data. RevealJS is the perfect way to give introductory information and conclusion information when presenting data. It also ensures that your information is presented in a simple way to understand and familiar to most people because a large majority of people are comfortable with slide presentations. 
<br>
<br>
Now shifting gears say I wanted to present this information to Seinfeld super fans, I could use Bootstrap or HTML to create a webpage that would feature all of the data I collected. Since super fans would be familiar with the show, I wouldn't need to introduce the show and communicate foundational information. By creating a webpage, I would be able to communicate the information still clearly and concisely. Still, the audience would be able to share the information among other fan groups easily. 
<br>
<br>
Another excellent example of how I could gear the way I communicate my data analysis is to share my Jupyter notebooks on sites like Kaggle, data.world, or share the raw files on GitHub. These sites are geared towards people interested in seeing how you can utilize code to tell stories with data. This audience would be less interested in having an aesthetically pleasing webpage or having a slide deck that gave a good overall picture of the data. Simply being able to share the notebook with all the code and pseudo code would be best geared towards an audience interested in data science. Through sites like Kaggle, data.world, and GitHub, the audience would be able to read over the code I used, and they would also have the opportunity to save the notebook and make any edits they deem necessary. They could also expand upon the code I have already written.

As you can see, there are no limitations to how you can communicate data analysis with the world! All you have to do is gauge your audience and have some fun.
