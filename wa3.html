<p>As Information Sciences, we have learned the power that ethics concerning content moderation and the sheer power of social media can affect the world. This is a highly debated topic in our field and many sides have been argued. There is no more excellent example of this power than what happened to the stock market on January 25th of this year. Due to the power of Reddit, users were able to create a subreddit that significantly impacted the stock market.
<br>
<br>
How did they do this, you might ask, through the subreddit users organized to trade Gamestop and AMC stocks. They chose to do this because Wall Street Hedge funds short sellers have been controlling the market by betting on stocks that they believe will continue to fall in value. When the Reddit users began to buy these stocks, it caused the hedge funds to continuously buy the stocks not to lose money because other sellers needed to keep buying options.
<br>
<br>
Now let’s dive into the Infomation Science part of this interesting moment in history. Looking at this event from a user side, Redditt users were able to use the platform to gain a following, then used that following to influence a whole market. Now from an ethics standpoint, should Redditt been able to anticipate this even through the moderation of the content being put out on their platform. Could Redditt have stopped the subreddit before it caused mass causes on Wall Street and caused Hedge funds to lose thousands upon thousands of dollars? Yes, they probably could have prevented this before it happened. Still, if the users were not technically breaking any guidelines for the platform’s use, it could be considered unethical to monitor and censor such content. 
<br>
<br>
Going even deeper into the ethics of the AMC and Gamestop debacle with the stock market is when we as Information Scientist consider the actions the app Robinhood took during this time. When the Robinhood platform realized what was happening with the stock market and the potential impacts that could occur if trading kept occurring, they put temporary trading restrictions on all stocks, including GameStop and AMC Entertainment Holdings. This upset a lot of people who expressed their feelings on social media. Users felt that they should be able to trade freely and that Robinhood was unethical in its restrictions. Many cited that the stock market is a free market, and regulations should not be put in place in order to protect rich investors who are losing money. 
<br>
<br>
Here we can see two sides of a conversation that is highly debating in the information Science field. How much moderation and restrictions should there be on social media platforms. You can see the effect that little moderation has when it comes to what happened with the subreddit. Then you can also see the implications of having too much moderation and restrictions have when looking at the Robinhood app. It is clear that social media’s power and the ethics behind how users utilize the internet are important and can have wide-reaching effects.
