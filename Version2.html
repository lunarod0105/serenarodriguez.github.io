<h2 style="text-align: center;">Time for some improvements</h2>

<div> Now nothing can be perfect on the first time so for my version 2 I adding some more elements to make my chart easier to read. First I wanted to make sure that the chart was scaled to fit inside of my web server. To do this i had to scale my chart! Casey Paul helped me find the widnow sizes for a macbook pro so that I would be able to rescale my chart. Some feedback I recieved from my version one was that it was hard to tell the number of missions. To fix this issue I added a feature that would allow the bars to show what the value was for that column.</div>
