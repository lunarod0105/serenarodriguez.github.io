<h2> A Deeper Dive into Seinfeld's Script </h2>

<p> Seinfeld is historically one of the most successful TV shows ever made. Its impact is still seen, as you can often find reruns on TV and people citing famous lines from the show even though it premiered shockingly 32 years ago. Seinfeld built its success on the premise that the show was about nothing. This challenged the previous ideology of storytelling that sitcoms have to be centered around important issues. Seinfeld instead focused on the day-to-day issues that ordinary people face with their main characters Seinfeld the (main protagonist), and his three of his friends â€“ George Costanza, former girlfriend, Elaine Benes, and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer offering observational humor to these issues. Looking at how the script of this famous show was built can give us a deeper understanding of how it could become a cultural phenomenon. To do this, we can look at how much each character talked throughout the seasons.</p>
<br>
<p>First, let's look at how much each of the characters spoke in the first season of the show. Looking at the Rotten Tomatoes score for the first Seinfeld season, there is a 75% critic rating and an 85% Audience score. The first season is described as laying out the template for the show's unique style. Using a Seinfield Script Dataset, I am able to analyze how many lines each character had within the first season. To better understand how much each character talks, I took the total number of lines the character had divided by the total number of lines spoken within that whole season. The graph below shows the percentage of lines each character had within season one. One important thing to note is that the percentage of lines for each of the main characters will not equal 100% of the lines within a season because other supporting characters are featured throughout the show. Their data is not vital for this analysis, so all supporting character lines fall within the other category. You can see that Jerry holds a majority of the speaking lines within the first season, and Kramer has the least amount of lines.</p>

<p>Now let's jump to the very last season to compare how much each character talked the first season. Going back to Rotten Tomatoes, we can see that the critic ratings for the last season were 61%, and the audience score was 90%. This season was described as ending the show on its terms, shocking fans and critics alike. Looking at the distribution of lines again the last season, you can see a more even distribution of lines among the show's main characters. Jerry still has a majority of the show lines, but Elaine and George are not too far behind him. Kramer still has the least amount of lines than any of the other main characters in the show. The other category shows the percentage of lines that came from non-main characters.</p>

<br>
<p>Learning the difference between the distribution of lines from season one compared to season nine gives us an idea of how the show progressed. To get a deeper understanding of the data, it is essential to look at the percentage of lines each character had during all the seasons (mean number of lines). When we look at this distribution, what we saw from seasons one and nine become more apparent. Jerry has 27% of the lines throughout all seasons of the show. George, Elaine, and Kramer all have similar percentages in the teens, but Kramer still has the lowest average number of lines among all of the main characters.</p>

<p>We can conclude from all of this information that Seinfeld had a pretty consistent formula when it came to writing their scripts. From the analysis, we can see that Jerry, across all seasons, had the most lines, followed by George, Elaine, then lastly Kramer. Now we have a deeper understanding of what helped contribute to the success of the show!</p>
